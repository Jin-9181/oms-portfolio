## 📚 Key Concepts Summary

### Concept 1: [procedural programming]
- giving instructions to computer to carry out an order
- 

### Coencept 2: [function]
- a segment of code that performs a specific task
- you drop something in (input) and it spits something out (output)
- functional programming is the fundamental of most modern programming. 

### Concept 3: [Method]
- A function that is part of a class in object-oriented programming (but colloquially, often used interchangeably with function).

### Concpet 4: [Object oriented programming]
- A programming paradigm where programmers define custom data types that have custom methods embedded within them.
-Object oriented programming is the paradigm that lets us create new concepts and teach them to the computer. What it means is there is some code that isn't executed in order when we execute our code.

### Concept 5: [Event oriented programming]
- A program awaits and reacts to events rather than running code line by line
- A type of programming where the program generally awaits and reacts to events rather than running code linearly

### Concept 6: [Logical operator]
- relational operators: ==, >, >=, < , <=
- boolean operators : and, or, not 

### Concept 7: [Mathmatical operator]
- +, -, *, /, %

### Concept 8: [Comments and documentation]
- Comments: Notes from the programmer supplied in-line alongside the code itself, designated in a way that prevents the computer from reading or attempting to execute them as code.
    - in line comments : written alongside the code 
    - larger comments : comments related to overall program 
    - code block comments : A code block comment is multiple comments one after the other, typically explaining something more complicated

- Documentation: Collected and set-aside descriptions and instructions for a body of code.
- Self-Documenting Code: Code whose variables and functions are named in a way that makes it clear what their underlying content and operations clear to the reader. 
    - Naming a function "countdown" when we are programming it to be counting down numbers inside the parenthesis

### Concept 9: [Idle] 
- Idle is a fast way to write code and see the result
- Also by creating a new python file (clicking command + N), we can write codes and check the result quickly.

## 🧠 How I Understand It (In My Own Words)
- Code can be designed in numerous ways. Same outcome doesn't mean same code. Coding is about structring your thoughts to have program that runs and does the job as you intended
- Good codes are the ones that are sefl explainatory
- Not all programming language automatically breaks the line at the end of print(). Some needs different coding to break the line and start a new line/paragraph
