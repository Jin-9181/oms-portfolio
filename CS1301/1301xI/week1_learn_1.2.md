## 📚 Key Concepts Summary

### Concept 1: [Programming]
- Definition: Writing code through an iterative process of writing lines of code, attempting to execute them, and evaluating the results.
- Key Takeaways: "Coding" and "programming" are often used interchangeably.
- Example: 

### Concept 2: [ Print() ]
- print(message): prints message to the console. message will often be a strign, but other types of data can be printed as well.
- print should have no upper class letter. 
- print will print anything inside the parenttheses. quotations will make the python interpret the text as text not code. 
- print is a type of function
- function will be followed by parenttheses
- python understands number, text with quotation, boolean(True or False)  

### Concept 3: [Complie]
- Static(complied) : language like Java or C that required compilation. 
- Dynamic(interpreted) : languages like Pythong or Javascript the don't require compilation. Run lines one by one
- To be truly precise, every language is "compiled" because compilation is necessary to translate our code into the instructions a computer can actually perform. The difference between static and dynamic languages is whether or not all the code is compiled before running any of it. In a static language, the entire program is compiled before it is run. In a dynamic language, the lines of code are compiled and run one at a time.
- In static language, the entire program won't run until errors are fixed.

### Concept 4: [Execute]
- errors: fundemental issues that will prevent the program from running as intended
- python is a dynamic language that runs line by line. So if I write 5 lines of code and I have a error on the 5th line, the first 4 lines of code will execute fine and I will find out there's an error after that. 
- we can have a compilation in python too. Development environment like PyCharm provides compilation. 

### Concept 5: [Error]
- error necessarily doesn't mean the line of code with errors is the core issue. It might go further way up to solve the issue. 
- For example, code that supposed to open a file faced an error. The error might be happening because the file doesn't exist. 
- With errors, the program is forced to stop

### Concept 6: [Incorrect results]
- program runs but the output is different from what we intended.

### Conecpt 7: [Pieces_in_Python]
- Red for reserved keywords
- blue for variables
- purple for functions
- green for strings

## 🧠 How I Understand It (In My Own Words)

- we want to write programs in small chunks. Try to write in small chunks and run it to check errors. 
- text with quotation will be interpreted as text itself. 
- Entire programing flow: writing code, running code, evaluating code: try to do this in small chunks 
- Python's Interactive Mode is a great tool for testing things out. It basically shows you the output of each individual line of code as you write it, and it "remembers" all previous lines of code that you've written. >>> will be code inputing. enter will show the result right away.

## ❓ Unclear Points / To Revisit

- [ ] (e.g.) Confused by nested conditionals inside if/else blocks
- [ ] (e.g.) Unsure when to use `for` vs `while` loops
