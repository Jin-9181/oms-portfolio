## 📚 Key Concepts Summary

### Concept 1: [code]
- Definition: a command given to a computer
- Key Takeaways: 
- Example: 

### Concept 2: [program]
- Definition: a collection of line of code that serves one or more overall function
- Key Takeaways: 
- Example:

### Concept 3: [input & output]
- Definition: anything we put into the program for it & anything that our program gives out based on our input
- Key Takeaways: 
- Example: out put could be several things (file, image, screen, sound)

### Concept 4: [compile]
- Definition:  reading over code and looking for errors in the way we've written it. Compiler is computer programs we rely on to do this.
- Key Takeaways: 
    - compile means only if it makes sense to the complier, it doesn't mean it will run as we intended
    - some compilation can be skipped/optional. 
    - language that does not require compilation is called "dynamic or interpreted language" the opposit called "static or compiled language"
- Example:
### Concept 5: [run]
- Definition: Actually running the program(line of code) we wrote. 
- Key Takeaways:
- Example:

### Concept 6: [GUI]
- Definition: systems that invloves input and output beyond just text (vs console) 
- Examples: Word, PowerPoing, Excel, Chrome. 
- 구이

### Concept 7: [console]
- definition: systems that invloevs only text based input and output 
- Takeaways: 
    - Easier and simpler to see how to program is running

### Concept 8: [debugging]
- definition: resolving erros that arise in my code

### Concept 9: [varaibles] 
- name of some piece of information
- value is information itself 

### Concept 10: [operators]
- Logical operators:
    - operators that check whether certain things are true or false
    - example: ==, >, <, >=, <=, is , and 
    - logiacal operators can be combined
- Mathmatical operators: 
    - multiplication, division, etc

### Concept 11: [control_structures]
- control structures : line of codes that control other lines of code
- conditionals: Lines of code (called if statements) that check logical expressions to see if certain code blocks should run (a.k.a if statement)
 - loops : repeat certain set of command , a certain number of times, until some certain conditions
- functions : liitle programs with their own input and output that helps us organize our code better
- exception : we don't want to handle every error cases, we just use exception and this is a conditional

### Concept 12: 
- Data Structures: The general idea of data types more complex than individual letters and numbers.
- Strings: Ordered series of characters that often represent natural human language. String are immutable. Can be reached using index.
- Lists: Ordered series of other kinds of data, collected under one variable name and accessed via numeric indices. uses "[]". Mutable. uses index to REST.
- File Input/Output: Writing a program's data to a file so it can later be re-loaded after the program is closed and reopened.
- Dictionaries: Pairs of keys and values collected under one variable name, like lists with non-numeric indices. uses "{}". Uses key instead of index

### Concept 13: [object oriented programming]
- Objects: Creating and using custom data types so our programs can reason about the world the way we do.
- Algorithms: Complex sequences of instructions that transform data or generate useful conclusions.

## 🧠 How I Understand It (In My Own Words)

- computing vs programming : learning to programming is learning to how to speak to computers. Computing is a broader perspective. 
- Foundatios of principles, implementation to language, achieve(apply) it within certain domain
- code segement 
    - left : line of code 
    - right : output
    - middle: code it self 
        - variable : blue
        - function: purple
        - reserved : red
        - string ; green 
        - input : bold + red
- Python
    - high level language: is eaiser to use compared to low level langauge. Is further away abstract from the inner working of computers
    - Dynamic & Interpreted: runs code line by line without the needs to be compiled. 
        - this means we may not be able to find errors of python before we run the code (complied languages do)

## ❓ Unclear Points / To Revisit

- [ ] (e.g.) Confused by nested conditionals inside if/else blocks
- [ ] (e.g.) Unsure when to use `for` vs `while` loops
