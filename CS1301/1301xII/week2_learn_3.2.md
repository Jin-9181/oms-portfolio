## 📚 Key Concepts Summary

### Concept 1: [conditional statement]
- Conditional Statements: Programming statements that control what code is executed based on certain conditions; usually of the form “if”, “else if”, and “else”.
- If-Then Statement: A conditional control structure that runs a block of code only if a certain condition is true.
- Else Statement: A conditional control structure that runs a block of code if all preceding if-then and else-if statements have been false.
    - Will always to something or the other
- Else If Statement :  a conditional control structure that runs a block of code if all preceding if-then and else-if statement have been false and some other conditions are met
- if writing conditional statement get unsure. Try to write a flowchart

### Concept 2 [ in ]
- "string " in [string1, string2, string 3, ..., stringx] is a boolean statement that returns True or False based on whether the "string" exist with in the [] list
- "string1" in "string2" is a boolean statement that returns True or False based on whether "string1" exist within the "string2" 
- string_varibale.isdigit() returns True if the variable is only cosist of digits. 
    - "12345".isdigit() returns True while "abcde".digit() returns false

### Concept 3 [nested conditional]
- a conditional statement that is itself controlled by another conditional statement. more simply, an if-then statement within another if-then statement
- in the nested conditional the if and else shoudl be in thdde same indenteation
- Ifs can be placed with in Elses

### Concept 4 [Scope]
- most of the programming languages, in the concept of scope, the variables cease to exist when the conditiona is done. 
- However, the variable inside the conditional will continue to exist, even after the condition is done.
- if you are creating a variable in a conditional, then create it on inside of each branch of conditionals (if and else) so, we can define the variable without missing. 
- Best case is to declare(define) a variable before any conditions.
