# Understanding String Comparison and ASCII in Python

This note explains how Python compares strings, especially when they contain digits, and how that differs from numeric comparison.

---

## ✅ Key Concept

> String comparison in Python is **lexicographical**, not numerical.  
> That means it compares characters **from left to right**, based on their **ASCII values**, not on overall numerical value.

---

## 📘 ASCII Reminder

Each character in a string has a corresponding ASCII (or Unicode) value.

| Character | ASCII Code |
|-----------|-------------|
| `'1'`     | 49          |
| `'2'`     | 50          |
| `'3'`     | 51          |
| `'9'`     | 57          |

## 🔍 Why `"12" > "3"` is False

```python
print("12" > "3")  # False
```

Explanation:

- `"12"` is compared **character by character**
- First characters: `'1'` vs `'3'`
- ASCII: `ord('1') = 49`, `ord('3') = 51`
- Since 49 < 51 → `"12"` is considered **less than** `"3"`

---

## 🧠 Important Rule

> Even if strings look like numbers, they are compared **as strings**, using **character codes**.

So:

- `"2" > "12"` → `'2'` (50) > `'1'` (49) → ✅ True
- `"12" < "3"` → `'1'` (49) < `'3'` (51) → ✅ True

---

## ❌ They are NOT compared as numbers

```python
print("12" > "3")       # False (string comparison)
print(int("12") > 3)    # True  (numeric comparison)
```

---

## ✅ Proper Numeric Comparison

If you want to compare numerical values from strings, you must convert them:

```python
a = "12"
b = "3"

print(int(a) > int(b))  # True
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Comparison Type | What It Does | Example | Result |
|------------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| String comparison (`>`, `<`) | Lexicographical (ASCII-based) | `"12" > "3"` | `False` |
| Numeric comparison | True numeric value | `int("12") > int("3")` | `True` |
| One-by-one character comparison | `'1'` vs `'3'` | `ord("1") = 49`, `ord("3") = 51` | 49 < 51 |

---

## 🧾 TL;DR

- Strings are compared by **characters**, **not numeric value**
- Use `int()` or `float()` if you need real number comparison
- ASCII values define the character ordering (not human intuition)
