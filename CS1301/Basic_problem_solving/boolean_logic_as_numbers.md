# 🧠 Boolean Logic as Numbers in Python

In Python, `True` and `False` aren't just logical values — they are also **integers**:
- `True` is treated as **1**
- `False` is treated as **0**

This allows you to perform powerful and compact calculations **without using `if` statements**.

## ✅ Why This Is Useful

Using boolean logic as numbers allows for:
- Cleaner, more compact code
- Branchless computation (better for performance)
- Seamless integration with mathematical operations
- Easier data analysis and simulation logic

## 🔢 Examples

### 1. Age Adjustment Without `if`

```python
# Given birthdate and current date
age = current_year - birth_year
age -= int((current_month, current_day) < (birth_month, birth_day))
```

### 2. General Logic Control

```python
x = 5
y = 10
adjusted_value = 100 - int(x < y)  # Subtract 1 if x < y is True
```

### 3. Conditional Bonus or Penalty

```python
score = 90
bonus = 5 * int(score >= 85)  # Add bonus only if score ≥ 85
```

## ⚙️ How Python Treats Booleans in Math

```python
print(True + True)     # 2
print(False * 100)     # 0
print(True * 3.14)     # 3.14
```

> Booleans are subclasses of `int` in Python.  
> `int(True)` → `1`  
> `int(False)` → `0`

## 🧠 Use Cases

| Area | Use |
|------|-----|
| Algorithms | Remove if-statements for faster execution |
| Data Analysis | Filter/count with boolean masks |
| Machine Learning | Loss conditions, masks |
| Financial Models | Adjust rates/fees based on conditions |

---

## 🧾 Summary

- Python treats `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`
- You can use `int(condition)` to include logic in calculations
- This helps write cleaner, faster, and more elegant code
- Great for real-world logic like date comparisons, conditionally applying bonuses, etc.
